(** operations on ldap dns *)

(** raised when something goes wrong with conversion to or from a
    string. The integer argument is the charachter which the lexer was
    looking at then the failure ocurred. In the case of to_string the
    integer argument will always be zero. *)
exception Invalid_dn of int * string

(** Given a string representation of a dn, return a structured
    representation.  unescapes any escape sequences present. *)
val of_string : string -> Ldap_types.dn

(** Given a structural representation of a dn, return a string
    representation.  Performs all the necessary escaping to correctly
    represent any structured representation. *)
val to_string : Ldap_types.dn -> string

(** Escape a string which you intend to be part of a VALUE in the
    dn. Do not use on the whole dn, just an attribute value. It is NOT
    necessary to use this if you intent to call to_string on your
    dn. It will be done for you as part of the conversion
    process. This function is exposed for the case where you find it
    easier to manipulate the dn via a regular expression, or other
    string based means, and you find it necessary to escape values. *)
